Replication of Sloan (1996) Accruals Anomaly Study

The accrual anomaly was defined in Sloan’s research paper in 1996. His key finding was that the investors are not fully 
taking into account the different properties of the accrual and cash flow components in the earnings. The cash flow 
component is more persistent than accruals. Since accruals will reverse in the future periods, their relative weight 
of the earnings can be used as a measure for earnings quality: the higher proportion of earnings from accruals the 
lower the earnings quality. (Sloan 1996).

The objective of this term paper is to reproduce the main results of the Sloan (1996) accrual anomaly related study. 
The data used in the empirical study is the Compustat data from the years between 1970 and 2012. The SAS program is 
used to perform the statistical analysis.

There has been an extensive amount of research done on accruals, since Sloan (1996) published his results on accruals 
anomaly. The Sloan experiment has been successfully replicated - repeatedly. The accrual anomaly is found to provide 
robust tool for evaluating the earnings quality, and identifying earnings management. Additionally, the accrual anomaly 
continues to provide useful tools for the sophisticated investors to earn abnormal stock returns. Brief review of the 
relevant research is presented in the chapter two.

The Sloan method and hypothesis to be reproduced are presented in more details in chapter three. The first hypothesis 
is that accruals are less persistent component of earnings than cash flow component. The second hypothesis is that 
abnormal stock returns can be earned by exploiting the investors’ inability to distinguish correctly between accrual 
and cash flow components of earnings. 

The analyzed results of the Sloan experiment replication are presented in chapters four and five. The Sloan finding 
that the accruals is less persistent component of the earnings is confirmed both with the descriptive data and the 
regression analysis. It is also confirmed, that it is possible to earn abnormal returns with the accruals based hedge 
portfolio. Thus, both of the hypothesis are supported.
